🧠 Fusion 360 3D Design Collection

A collection of custom 3D models designed by me in Autodesk Fusion 360, inspired by various real-world objects, concepts, and creative ideas.  
All designs are optimized for 3D printing (FDM/Resin) and shared here for learning, experimentation, and improvement.

🧩 About This Project

This repository contains several original designs I modeled in Fusion 360.  
Each design was created as part of my exploration into digital fabrication, CAD modeling, and design for 3D printing.

While some models draw inspiration from existing designs, every part was modeled from scratch by me, refined for better printability and aesthetics.
